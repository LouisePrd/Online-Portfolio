            If you've stumbled upon League of Legends and think you know everything there is to know about the game, you've come to the right place. Use all those hours spent playing to learn about the characters, their skills, and how to play to challenge yourself. Climb the rankings and show everyone that, even if you can't win games, you at least know the lore. ü§ì<br><br>

            And a little bonus for the die-hard fans: Smash or Pass! Usually played in a group, this mode consists of judging which champions in the game you find attractive or not.<br>
            Smash = Attractive
            Pass = Not interested, pass<br>

            Don't hesitate to check out the statistics page with the most smashed and most passed, it sometimes reveals unexpected results... Good luck, have fun!
