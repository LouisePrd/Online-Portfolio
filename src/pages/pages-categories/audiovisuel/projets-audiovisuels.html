    <h2>Le Making-Of Sauvage (The Wild Making-Of)</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <h3>THEME & REALIZATION</h3>
        <p><br>As part of our audiovisual course during the first semester of our first year at IMAC, we had to produce a group short film, averaging ten minutes. Originally, we considered following two different groups, but we eventually decided to focus on just one, as the content was rich and provided plenty of material very quickly. 
            The challenge was significant because nothing was scripted, and we had to adapt to every situation. Our own scenario was built progressively during the filming process.
            <br><br>We embedded ourselves in their filming sessions, rehearsals, and meetings to gather as much content as possible. We also conducted interviews with the group members to capture their perspective on the project.
            Our group consisted of 3 students, and we edited the film using Adobe Premiere Pro.

    <h2>The Great Worldw<b><u>AI</u></b>de Conspiracy</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <h3>THEME & REALIZATION</h3>
        <p><br>
            <b>Theme</b>: Truth<br>
            <b>Sub-theme</b>: Transhumanism<br>
            <b>Subject</b>: Is our judgment always well-founded? Who holds the truth? Are we not all someone else's "ignorant person"?<br><br>

            Edited on Premiere Pro and directed by a group of 4 students, the objective of this short film was to present a team of journalists convinced they know the truth: this world is ruled by artificial intelligence. Every human possesses gadgets that control their thoughts via an algorithm that chooses the "best" and most "optimized" way to live one's life according to a defined norm. The world is completely unaware of this governance.<br><br>

            <b>External Point of View</b><br>
            We play conspiracy theorist characters filming a documentary to reveal to the world that they are actually controlled by AI. Except for us, none of the actors were aware that it was a staged performance.<br><br>

            <b>Organization of Ideas</b><br>
            At the end, we discover a second film crew making a documentary about the conspiracy theorists we had been following from the start. This crew is convinced they've played a trick on them and are mocking them, but they, too, are being filmed by an algorithm.<br><br>

        <h3>MIXING</h3>
        <p>The year at IMAC was very productive, and during the second semester, we had the opportunity to work on audio creation and mixing. For this project, we were tasked with creating a sound mix from a simplified multitrack version of Michael Jackson's <i>Off The Wall</i>, separated into 23 tracks. 
            From there, we had free rein: cutting, reorganizing, playing with volume, effects, echoes, reverbs, etc. 
            Here is the result of our work, created using ProTools.<br></p>

    <h2>Black Mirror: Reconnection</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="left-container">
            <h3>SUBJECT</h3>
            <p>As part of a course called "Application Production Methodology," we had to produce a synopsis inspired by the famous Netflix series Black Mirror. This episode had to blend ethics and computer science, and I chose to work on the theme of the metaverse and artificial intelligence. The episode is titled "Reconnection".</p>

            <h3>WORK DONE</h3>
            <p>We had to write a three-act synopsis and produce a teaser in any form. I chose to create a video teaser, various poster prototypes, and a potential casting list.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="right-container">
            <h3>EXPLANATION</h3>
            <p>The goal of this scenario was to prompt reflection on our identity in the online space and the role we will give to artificial intelligence in the coming years. In this fictional episode, we follow a young man in his thirties whose identity is stolen by an AI in the metaverse. He falls into a blind rage, ready to do anything to eliminate his avatar.</p>
            <p>
                The teaser gives a glimpse of the metaverse through an interview with Facebook's General Manager, Laurent Solly, and introduces the inciting incident with a VR headset followed by an interview with the company's customer service. Classmates lent their voices for the acting.
