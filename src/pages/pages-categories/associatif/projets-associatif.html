        <h2>GIC</h2>
        <p class="intro">The GIC is the association of creative engineers at ESIEE Paris. <br>We connect the arts,
            sciences, and student life by organizing projects that bring people together and leave a special lasting
            impression.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h3>President – Oct. 2024 to June 2025</h3>
            <p>As president, I invested myself in growing the association and making it more vibrant than ever,
                particularly with the recent merge between Gustave Eiffel University and ESIEE Paris.</p>

            <p>Some notable events from the year:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IMACannes</strong>: our annual ceremony that celebrates creativity,
                    writing, mastery of audiovisual imagery, editing, post-production, and
                    special effects by students in the IMAC program. Complete organization of the event:
                    communication, logistics, film selection, jury, ceremony. </li>
                <li><strong>The End-of-Year Gala</strong>: the grand closing night for all graduating classes,
                    which I coordinate with the team. </li>
                <li><strong>The JeudiMACs</strong>: regular get-togethers to build bonds between graduating classes
                    through fun and creative activities. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Events Coordinator - July 2024 to January 2025</h3>
            <p>Before becoming president, I was the events manager, responsible for creating, coordinating, and
                organizing GIC events with the team. Student life can sometimes be intimidating, especially at a large
                school like ESIEE, and I wanted to help create a welcoming environment through team-building events and
                creative collaborations.</p>

            <p>We organized the Journées de Cohésion at the beginning of the year, as well as themed weekly afterworks.
                These evenings included various activities such as the “Jeu du Killer”, a makeup contest, and a
                Christmas workshop focused on creation, sharing, and festive atmosphere. The idea was to encourage
                exchanges, stimulate creativity, and create a real community around creativity in engineering..</p>

                    Cohesion Days: these days are a traditional cohesion event for students at
                    ESIEE Paris, particularly for creative engineers, organized by the
                    GIC. A time to forge links between classes and encourage creativity on the
                    theme of Harry Potter.
