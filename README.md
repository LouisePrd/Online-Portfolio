# Online-Portfolio

As mentioned in my profile, my name is Louise and I'm studying creative engineering at ESIEE Paris (IMAC training). With this portfolio, I wanted to share the works that inspire me in my everyday life, as well as my own projects during my studies.<br>
It's not finished yet and will be updated regularly. You'll also find all the contact information you need to get in touch with me.<br><br>
Have a nice browsing :)<br>
